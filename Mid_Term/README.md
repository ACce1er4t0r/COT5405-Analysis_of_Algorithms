# Mid Term Exam

There are some small errors in the solution of the first question, and Bonus was not successfully solved, update later when I am free

## Problem 1 [40] 

Consider the problem of providing change to an arbitrary amount N using US currency denominations, i.e $0.01, $0.05, $0.10, $0.25, $1, $5, $10, $20, $50, $100. 

Find a polynomial algorithm that, when given N, finds the exact change (or indicates that such change is not possible) using the minimum number of coins/banknotes.

## Problem 2 [30+10] 

Given a binary tree, provide an efficient algorithm that finds the length of and the actual sequence for the longest path starting at the root and terminating at a leaf [30]. 

If we now assume that tree edges have weights, how does the algorithm need to be modified to accommodate the generalization? 

## Problem 3 [20] 

Suppose you are given an array A[1..n] of distinct sorted integers that have been circularly shifted
k positions to the right (for an unknown k). 

For example, [35, 42, 5, 15, 27, 29] is a sorted array that has been circularly shifted k = 2 positions, while [27, 29, 35, 42, 5, 15] has been shifted k = 4 positions.

We can obviously find the largest element in A in O(n) time. Describe an O(log n) algorithm.

## Bonus [30] 

For problem 1, find the most general set of currency (i.e. denominations for said currency) so that the algorithm you found is still correct. 

Specifically, identify the most general property you can find that the set of values should satisfy so that the algorithm still works. 

Your solution will be judged based on generality. Unless the solution is correct and the generalization is non-trivial, no points will be awarded.
