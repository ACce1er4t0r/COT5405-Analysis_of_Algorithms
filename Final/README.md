# Mid Term Exam

There are some small errors in the solution of the second question, update later when I am free

## Problem 1: Dynamic programming [35]

A thief is robbing a store that has n items. 

The ith item is worth $v_i$ dollars, weighs $w_i$ pounds and can be grabbed in $t_i$ time, where $v_i$, $w_i$ and $t_i$ are integers. 

He wants to take as valuable a load as possible, but he can carry at most $W$ pounds in his knapsack, and can only spend $T$ time before the police arrive. 

Which items should he take to maximize the total value? All values involved are integers. 

## Problem 2: Network flow [35]

Given an undirected graph $G(V, E)$, determine the minimum number of edges that can be disconnected to partition the graph in such a way that two given vertices $s, t \in V$ are in separate partitions. 

**Hint:** reduce the problem to max flow or one of the variants discussed in class. 

Make sure you provide a complete algorithm and indicate a possibly specialized version of max flow that can be used. 

Indicate the complexity of this specialized algorithm.


## Problem 3 Complexity [30]

Problem to consider -- given a set of integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$, determine if there is a way to partition the set into two parts in such a way that the sum of the values for each subset is the same. 

Provide a complete proof that the problem is NP-complete. Hint:  use a reduction from Subset-Sum; make sure you have all the elements of the proof in place.
